"""rat_in_a_maze.py

This program explores all possible paths in a maze using backtracking. It starts from the top-left corner
of the maze and recursively explores all valid paths until it reaches the bottom-right corner. The is_valid
function checks whether a given cell is inside the maze and unblocked. The find_path function recursively
explores all valid directions from the current cell and backtracks when necessary. Finally, the main function
initializes the maze and calls the find_path function to find all valid paths.
