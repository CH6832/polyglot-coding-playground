Certainly! Here's a basic implementation of the Gift Wrapping algorithm (also known as Jarvis March) for finding the convex hull of a set of points in Python:

python

def orientation(p, q, r):
    """
    Function to find orientation of ordered triplet (p, q, r).
    Returns:
     0 --> p, q and r are colinear
     1 --> Clockwise
    -1 --> Counterclockwise
    """
    val = (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - q[0]) - (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - q[1])
    if val == 0:
        return 0  # Colinear
    return 1 if val > 0 else -1  # Clockwise or Counterclockwise

def convex_hull(points):
    """
    Returns the convex hull of a set of points using Gift Wrapping algorithm (Jarvis March).
    """
    n = len(points)
    if n < 3:
        return None  # Convex hull not possible

    hull = []

    # Find the leftmost point
    l = min(range(n), key=lambda i: points[i][0])

    p = l
    q = 0
    while True:
        hull.append(p)
        q = (p + 1) % n
        for i in range(n):
            if orientation(points[p], points[i], points[q]) == -1:
                q = i
        p = q
        if p == l:
            break

    # Build the convex hull using the points
    convex_hull_points = [points[i] for i in hull]
    return convex_hull_points

# Example usage:
points = [(0, 3), (2, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 0), (0, 0), (3, 3)]
convex_hull_points = convex_hull(points)
print("Convex Hull Points:", convex_hull_points)

# This implementation finds the convex hull of a set of points using the Gift Wrapping algorithm, which iteratively selects the points on the convex hull by finding the next point with the smallest polar angle with respect to the current point. The orientation() function is used to determine the orientation of three points, and the convex_hull() function applies the Gift Wrapping algorithm to the input set of points. Finally, the convex hull points are returned.
