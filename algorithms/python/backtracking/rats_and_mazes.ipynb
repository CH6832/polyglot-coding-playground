    "# Rats & Mazes\n",
    "# First, create a Blackboard (cite reference) which is an object on which\n",
    "# anyone may record information. This particular blackboard draws a maze,\n",
    "# and is used as information comes back about the structure of a maze from\n",
    "# the rats that are investigating it. Add Comment\n",
    "# Now create the maze itself. Like a real maze, this object reveals very little\n",
    "# information about itself — given a coordinate, it will tell you whether there\n",
    "# are walls or spaces in the four directions immediately surrounding that\n",
    "# coordinate, but no more. For starters, read the maze in from a text file but\n",
    "# consider hunting on the internet for a maze-generating algorithm. In any\n",
    "# event, the result should be an object that, given a maze coordinate, will\n",
    "# report walls and spaces around that coordinate. Also, you must be able to\n",
    "# ask it for an entry point to the maze. Add Comment\n",
    "# Finally, create the maze-investigating Rat class. Each rat can\n",
    "# communicate with both the blackboard to give the current information\n",
    "# and the maze to request new information based on the current position of\n",
    "# the rat. However, each time a rat reaches a decision point where the maze\n",
    "# branches, it creates a new rat to go down each of the branches. Each rat is\n",
    "# driven by its own thread. When a rat reaches a dead end, it terminates\n",
    "# itself after reporting the results of its final investigation to the blackboard.\n",
    "# Add Comment\n",
    "# The goal is to completely map the maze, but you must also determine\n",
    "# whether the end condition will be naturally found or whether the\n",
