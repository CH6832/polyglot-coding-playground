Certainly! Below is a basic implementation of Newton's method in Python without using any third-party libraries:

python

def f(x):
    return x**3 - 2*x - 5

def df(x):
    return 3*x**2 - 2

def newtons_method(initial_guess, tolerance, max_iterations):
    x0 = initial_guess

    for i in range(max_iterations):
        fx0 = f(x0)
        if abs(fx0) < tolerance:
            print(f"Converged to solution: {x0} after {i} iterations")
            return x0
        fprime_x0 = df(x0)
        if fprime_x0 == 0:
            print(f"No convergence, derivative is zero at {x0}")
            return None
        x0 = x0 - fx0 / fprime_x0
    
    print("Did not converge within the maximum number of iterations.")
    return None

# Example usage:
initial_guess = 2  # Initial guess
tolerance = 1e-6   # Tolerance for convergence
max_iterations = 1000  # Maximum number of iterations

root = newtons_method(initial_guess, tolerance, max_iterations)
if root is not None:
    print("Root:", root)

In this implementation:

    The f(x) function represents the equation whose root we want to find.
    The df(x) function represents the derivative of f(x).
    The newtons_method function implements Newton's method, taking an initial guess, tolerance for convergence, and maximum number of iterations as parameters.
    It iteratively updates the guess using the formula x = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0) until either the tolerance is met or the maximum number of iterations is reached.
    If a root is found within the tolerance, it prints the result and returns the root. Otherwise, it prints a message indicating convergence failure.

You can modify the f(x) and df(x) functions to represent your specific equation and its derivative.
