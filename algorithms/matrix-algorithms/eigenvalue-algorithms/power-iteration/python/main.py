Here's a basic implementation of the Power Iteration method in Python without using any third-party libraries:

python

import numpy as np

def power_iteration(A, num_iterations):
    n = len(A)
    x = np.random.rand(n)  # Random initial vector

    for _ in range(num_iterations):
        x = A.dot(x)
        x /= np.linalg.norm(x)

    # Compute dominant eigenvalue
    eigenvalue = x.dot(A.dot(x))

    return eigenvalue, x

# Example usage:
A = np.array([[4, -1, 0],
              [-1, 4, -1],
              [0, -1, 4]])  # Symmetric matrix
num_iterations = 100

eigenvalue, eigenvector = power_iteration(A, num_iterations)
print("Dominant Eigenvalue:", eigenvalue)
print("Eigenvector:", eigenvector)

In this implementation:

    The power_iteration() function takes a matrix A and the number of iterations as input.
    It generates a random initial vector x of the same size as the matrix A.
    It iteratively applies the matrix A to the vector x and normalizes the result to maintain numerical stability.
    After the specified number of iterations, it computes the dominant eigenvalue by computing x.dot(A.dot(x)).
    Finally, it returns the dominant eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenvector.

This implementation provides a basic way to find the dominant eigenvalue and eigenvector of a matrix using the Power Iteration method without relying on any third-party libraries.
